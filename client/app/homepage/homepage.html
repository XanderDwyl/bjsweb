I frequently learn languages in minutes. I've written programs in Perl, PHP, Javascript, and other languages that I don't actually "speak".
</p>
<p>
Once you know a few languages, a lot of the same ideas keep coming up over and over. All of the languages I've mentioned are fundamentally pretty similar. There exist genuinely different languages in the world, like Prolog, Haskell, and Scheme; compared to those, the languages I mentioned are all largely the same. The differences are easily looked up.

<p>
I don't speak them "idiomatically". That comes only from using it for a few months or years. Nor do I know all of the available libraries and toolsets; they too take months or years to learn. But the basics of a language can be learned in an afternoon, or even less.
